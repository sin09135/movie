In 1986, De Keersmaeker first ventured into the terrain of contemporary classical music with Bartók's string quartet Quartet No. 4. In a choreography punctuated by both playful and combative accents, De Keersmaeker took on the task of distilling a dance score out of Bartók's complex rhythms and layered harmonies. In the Grosse Fuge (1992), De Keersmaeker sets out to find a male vocabulary, with Rosas’ dancers challenging gravity in a piece that sought to provide a physical translation of Beethoven's ingenious use of counterpoint. The final piece of the evening, Verklärte Nacht (1995), presents a shamelessly romantic love story, in which the contrasting feelings of a man and a woman are dissected and interpreted in an expressive duet based on Schönberg's eponymous musical score.",2015-10-21,0.857,0.0,0.0,An evening with Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker at the Opéra National de Paris,en,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a choreography punctuated by both playful and combative accents, De Keersmaeker took on the task of distilling a dance score out of Bartók's complex rhythms and layered harmonies. In the Grosse Fuge (1992), De Keersmaeker sets out to find a male vocabulary, with Rosas’ dancers challenging gravity in a piece that sought to provide a physical translation of Beethoven's ingenious use of counterpoint. The final piece of the evening, Verklärte Nacht (1995), presents a shamelessly romantic love story, in which the contrasting feelings of a man and a woman are dissected and interpreted in an expressive duet based on Schönberg's eponymous musical score.",2015-10-21,0.857,0.0,0.0,An evening with Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker at the Opéra National de Paris,en,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

collection,The Joy of Sex Education,"A survey of sex education through the ages.  Many of the early films highlight Britain's horror at the very thought of sex and sexuality. Euphemisms abound and, if you can get away with making your point with the aid of a few birds or rabbits, why not? Even some mildly amorous pollen gets in on the act as a stand-in for something otherwise far too unpleasant to show. At least it saved the teachers' blushes.  Despite the often unintentional humour, the films provide a vivid snapshot of the nation's concerns and anxieties across the decades. Not only did they teach us to keep our trousers firmly zipped, but also managed to underline the establishment's attitude towards women. Loose of morals and self-control, women are invariably portrayed as the spreaders of disease and responsible for just about every 'misfortune' that comes their way.",,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a choreography punctuated by both playful and combative accents, De Keersmaeker took on the task of distilling a dance score out of Bartók's complex rhythms and layered harmonies. In the Grosse Fuge (1992), De Keersmaeker sets out to find a male vocabulary, with Rosas’ dancers challenging gravity in a piece that sought to provide a physical translation of Beethoven's ingenious use of counterpoint. The final piece of the evening, Verklärte Nacht (1995), presents a shamelessly romantic love story, in which the contrasting feelings of a man and a woman are dissected and interpreted in an expressive duet based on Schönberg's eponymous musical score.",2015-10-21,0.857,0.0,0.0,An evening with Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker at the Opéra National de Paris,en,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
